            Going “off grid” has become increasingly desired in recent years &
            marketed to overwhelmed Millennials. However, a "digital break"
            normally means ignoring notifications. Is it possible to completely
            go offline for an extended period of time?

        <p>
          When we talk about “going offline”, we tend to mean simply ignoring
          the constant notifications from social media, texts from friends, and
          relentless marketing emails. “Offline” as a concept has even been
          commodified in the form of dedicated retreats catered to the
          overwhelmed millennial (Getaway Cabins anyone?). I have been guilty of
          apologizing for a weekend of ignoring messages using the excuse of “I
          was trying to avoid screens”, all while doom-scrolling on another
          platform that is masquerading as less social interaction. Having spent
          the past few weeks being forced to look down the barrel of how much
          data I leak on a daily basis just by existing I found myself wanting
          to test this boundary. How much information about myself and my daily
          life do I unintentionally hand over to the companies of products that
          I use? Would it even be possible for me to function without being
          attached to my iPhone?
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think I’m aware of my device dependencies and often consider
          myself a late-adopter of digital tools and services. This was probably
          a by-product of my dad’s simultaneous love of technology (he was an
          early MS DOS engineer & computer salesman) and skepticism of digital
          life (he refused to trust cloud-based services). For example, I
          refused to use Apple Pay even when most of my peers did. It was only
          once I had forgotten my wallet at work one day (and thankfully had my
          card details memorized) that I caved and added my card to the platform
          as an alternative to going hungry at lunch. I never looked back. I
          even immediately switched over to using OMNY (New York City’s
          contactless payment system for public transit) instead of my
          MetroCard. Once the floodgates were opened, the transition was rapid
          and ubiquitous.
        </p>
        <p>
          When planning this experiment, I initially suggested going entirely
          offline for a whole week. I quickly realized this would be impossible.
          As a user experience design student, my degree quite literally
          revolves around digital products. A weekend, then? e. But what about
          social obligations and errands that required me to leave my home? How
          would I do this without shutting myself in my apartment all weekend to
          avoid having to deal with the lack of a phone? The amount of crochet I
          would compensate with would give me blisters that would outlast my
          digital detox by a considerable amount.
        </p>
        <p>I opted for a dynamic duo of the weekend and strict rules.</p>
        <p>The rules were as follows:</p>
        <!-- list is below -->
        <p class="q2">
          Total disengagement is impossible (between my smart bulbs and package
          room lock in my apartment building). Instead, my aim is to limit and
          document any screen time. I’ll track this easily via Apple’s handy
          dandy Screen Time feature.
        </p>
        <p class="q2">
          Only work can be done on my laptop - because why on earth would anyone
          even try and do HTML on paper?
        </p>
        <p class="q2">
          I must use my phone as little as possible, and place it in airplane
          mode when not in use. (Note: this rule was broken almost immediately,
          but no spoilers!)
        </p>
        <p class="q2">
          Duolingo is allowed, I can’t face the shame of breaking my Korean
          streak.
        </p>
        <!-- List end -->
        <p>
          Running a quick audit of my phone, I recorded the screen-time for the
          similar time period the weekend before the experiment. On Friday, it
          was around 90 minutes, for Saturday/Sunday I clocked in at over 3
          hours (it was a non-productive, rot away on the internet kind of
          weekend)... How often I lifted my phone (“pick ups”) stayed about the
          same, no matter how long I spent on my phone - about 175 each day.
          Seeing numbers in the triple digits makes me feel like I’m in
          confessional for my obvious dependence on my phone, but I promised
          myself brutal honesty when I set out to do this project, so here we
          go!
        </p>

        <h2>Day 1</h2>

        <p>
          Realizing how hard this was going to be was as instant as the
          notifications popping up on my lock screen upon waking. A weekend full
          of obligations sounds like a great test until you realize that both
          tickets for the events you’re attending are digital. Here’s that
          near-immediate rule change I warned you about - it was either waste
          $30 or use my phone. I’m pretty sure you’d make the same choice I
          made. Speaking of wasting money, I also realized I was a day shy of
          reaching my weekly transit fee cap and earning free rides for the rest
          of the weekend. In true thrifty student fashion, I refused to pay more
          money for subway rides than necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subway does bring up a good point: it showed me just how much I
          rely on my phone as a crutch or distraction. Train rides without music
          were rough. Had I not been on my way to a Halloween party for my
          second trip of the day I definitely would have brought a book. Or a
          crochet project. Or a sudoku. Anything to avoid stewing in my own
          thoughts for 45 minutes. It was also interesting to be the only person
          not on my phone in the group at said Halloween party during lulls in
          the evening.I missed catching some photos that my friends uploaded to
          Instagram stories. They are lost to the void of the internet. Then
          again, isn’t that sort of the poetic point of “disposable” stories?
        </p>
        <p>
          The plus side of Day 1? My geography of NYC south of the grid system
          is infinitely better than I thought it was! There was a point in my
          afternoon where I very seriously considered going full Zillenial and
          printing a Google Maps page for my instructions for the evening, but
          thankfully I made it through the LES without it.
        </p>

        <h2>Day 2</h2>

        <p>
          Having very few plans on Sunday felt like a little bit of a cheat day
          after the amount of navigating (both of the city and life without a
          phone post-addicted state) I had done the day before. However, I did
          have a <b>lot</b> of errands that had me running around my own
          neighborhood, as well as laundry that, thanks to the ‘high tech’
          upgrades my building has implemented, now requires my phone. Aside
          from these complications, there was something to be said for being
          home for a while and not having my phone as a crutch to doom-scroll.
          To my own surprise (and credit), I did not cheat and use a different
          device. Aside from my rule-abiding ~300 lines of CSS, anyway. While
          Saturday was more a practical test of limiting my device usage and how
          well I could function in my daily life (the answer was,
          disappointingly but admittedly unsurprisingly, not at all). Sunday was
          more about <i>intentionally disconnecting</i>
          myself from my device and removing a form of entertainment that has
          hacked away at my attention span in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t think I was significantly more productive on Sunday than I
          would have been without my phone - I just compensated in different,
          probably healthier ways. That said, I’m starting to think they might
          be onto something with this blue light lark (read: very well proven
          studies that show the disruption of blue light). I’m convinced that I
          woke up on Monday morning more well-rested than I have in a while.
          Maybe it’s time to go back to reading on paper despite having yellow
          tones activated on literally everything once I’ve logged off from my
          work for the day…
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          For my endpoint data, I clocked in at about 1 hour of screen time on
          Saturday (somehow still with 167 pick-ups?) and about 1 hour 15
          minutes on Sunday (126 pick-ups). So do I think I was successful in
          reducing my data leakage? Probably not. If I had to build a picture of
          my life for the weekend based purely on the data from my phone it
          would probably be surprisingly complete. The MTA knows I left the UES,
          then left the LES a few hours later. Google knows that I cheated and
          looked up a pizza spot at midnight on the LES. The company that runs
          my laundry room knows I ran 3 washers and 1 dryer. All companies know
          exactly at what time, and at which coordinates, I performed these
          actions. While I was successful in disconnecting myself from social
          media for the weekend, I was still tagged in posts, even if I never
          saw these myself. My life is so closely intertwined with technology
          (not just my phone) that completely extracting myself was functionally
          impossible. Do I think the minor data leakage I may have secured is a
          gateway to going completely cold turkey and rebuilding some aspects of
          my home and life technology-free? Absolutely not.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it was interesting to think about how much of my attention
          had been unavailable for companies to barter for. With plenty of
          conversations in the past few weeks about the attention economy and
          the concept of consuming advertisements online, how much of my time
          that would normally have been available was taken out of the equation?
          The answer, quantifiably, is about 2 - 4 hours daily. Though not a
          significant amount in the eyes of advertisers, it is a huge amount in
          the eyes of an individual user. I had been reduced to the 50% of
          potentially wasted advertising - only being exposed to non-targeted
          adverts like billboards or that one gross subway ad for The League. I
          may still have been leaking significant data, but at least I wasn’t
          donating hours of my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          On reflection, this experiment was a great way to become more
          cognizant of what data I am subconsciously leaking on a daily basis, a
          little during the weekend itself, but even more when I returned to
          “normal”. Trying to go entirely offline in the course of my everyday
          life was more stressful than I anticipated. It was certainly made
          clear why the popular retreats and weekends spent away from the
          incessant demands for our attention that our devices and social media
          make. If you are feeling inclined to give yourself the slightly harsh
          wake-up call that I received, a similar challenge may be helpful. You
          will likely learn some unwelcome things about your dependence on the
          digital world as well as how much information you provide to companies
          on an almost minute-by-minute basis. On the other hand, you might
          notice ways to recover a decreased attention span or finally get a
          better night's sleep. Do I think I’ll be doing “digital detoxes''
          regularly after this? Probably not. But you know what? A Getaway Cabin
          sounds much more appealing than it did 2 weeks ago.
