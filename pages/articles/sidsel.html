      <article>
        <p>
          I was 9 when I learned what a pacemaker was. On a February night in
          2005, my family and I were watching a Champions League handball game
          when the Danish folk hero and Olympic champion Anja Andersen
          collapsed. I remember thinking she would break into little pieces. 
          Terrifying images unfolded across tiny  pixels on the TV as we all
          held our breath. Silence spread from the commentators’ booth into the
          thousands of living rooms tuned into the game. It felt like forever
          before Andersen finally moved again.  My mom, a nurse, explained what
          the seemingly all-knowing commentators could not. Kneeling down to
          meet my 9-year old eyes, she described how Anja Andersen’s heart
          wasn’t like hers or mine: it needed support from a machine to keep
          beating properly. 12 years later, this machine would make it off the
          distant pixelated handball court and into my own family: when my
          grandfather’s heart weakened, he underwent a pacemaker implantation to
          survive. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The first successful implantation of a pacemaker happened in Sweden in
          1958. A lot has changed since then: implanting the devices is now an
          ordinary operation all over the world, with more than 3 million people
          having ever had one, and approximately 1.43 million people actively
          carrying one. Unfortunately, these technological improvements have
          been made without appropriate accompanying regulation.  As cloud- and
          wireless technology evolve, regulations regarding data privacy,
          protection, and security are limping behind. Until now. 
        </p>
        <p>Supposedly.</p>
        <p>
          New regulations regarding cybersecurity in embedded medical devices
          have arrived. But do they actually provide desperately-needed
          safeguards?
        </p>
        <p>
          Neta Alexander was 33 years old when she received her pacemaker. Ever
          since, she has been acting as an ambassador and activist for fellow
          people with  pacemakers. She complains that she has no idea who has
          access to her data. Why is this a problem? Pacemakers collect
          vulnerable and personal information - such as sleeping schedule - and
          share it with complete strangers. The information is tracked for
          multiple reasons. One is for the pacemaker to eject an electrical
          shock if the heart beats less than 25 times per minute. This is to
          maintain a healthy heart rhythm. Another reason is for doctors to
          monitor the patterns of a patient's heart over a longer period of time
          to draw medical conclusions. Neta Alexandre describes how the very
          data that might be keeping her alive by being available to doctors,
          could, in the wrong hands, make her a victim of a potentially lethal
          hacking attack. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, CNN and Cylance CEO Stuart McClure reported that pacemakers
          and insulin pumps were at high risk of being hacked by bad actors. The
          report revealed that it only takes a small antenna and a line of code
          to hack into nearly any wireless medical device such as pacemakers,
          insulin pumps and defibrillators. In 2018, at the Black Hat convention
          in Las Vegas, this issue was emphasized through a live enactment of
          this exact hacking technique. Pacemakers were easily hackable because
          their parent company Medtronic failed to incorporate encryption in
          their programming. This enabled anyone to see and modify the code.
          This carried potentially disastrous consequences: an intruder in the
          system could adjust when to give electric impulses into the heart -
          and when not to. Both scenarios could be lethal. Even though Medtronic
          resolved one of the cloud vulnerabilities mentioned at the Black Hat
          conference, researchers Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts remained
          convinced the security was lacking. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been over a decade since the first concerns regarding patient
          safety and data security were raised by scientists like Billy Rios and
          Jonathan Butts and patients like Neta Alexander. And although medical
          companies have been adjusting their practices, it took until march of
          this year for the FDA to commit to a new cybersecurity law that will
          regulate how medical companies secure privacy data from patients with
          embedded technology in their bodies. Initially, the new FDA
          regulations are focused on premarket medical devices, ensuring a new
          higher level of security before a new generation of devices and
          softwares are placed in patients’ bodies. in the Regulatory Law Review
          at Penn Carey Law at University of Pennsylvania, Professor Christopher
          S. Yoo and Bethany Lee reported that the FDA guidelines vaguely
          defined “trustworthiness” of medical devices. ​​Yoo and Lee argue
          that‘trustworthy’ medical devices are ones that “(1) are reasonably
          secure from cybersecurity intrusion and misuse; (2) provide a
          reasonable level of availability, reliability, and correct operation;
          (3) are reasonably suited to performing their intended functions; and
          (4) adhere to generally accepted security procedures.” Moving forward,
          it will be interesting to follow how new devices on the market will
          differ from previous ones.  Although the new trustworthy products will
          improve future  patient’s security, I am skeptical as to how they fix
          this data security issue for the millions of existing patients. On the
          15th of November, the FDA contracted with MITRE, a not-for-profit R&D
          company, to investigate the next steps in improving legacy
          implementations. Due to the novelty of this decision, its implications
          remain to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          These new guidelines are a great first step. However, I assume the FDA
          is not only motivated by concerns regarding hacking and privacy
          covered in this and countless pieces published this past decade. Other
          interests might relate to profits, as the technological development of
          wearable and embedded technology booms. In September of this year,
          Elon Musk’ company NeuraLink was approved by the FDA for human trials.
          NeuraLink intends to embed wireless brain computers in paralyzed
          patients with the intention to expand to other neurological
          conditions. On paper, those intentions sound great, but knowing the
          controversial past of Musk. NeuraLink was accused of animal cruelty
          when they engaged in animal testing of the brain chips in monkey last
          year. These new FDA regulations will hopefully help new innovative
          technology companies like NeuraLink to adhere to a higher ethical
          codex than previously expected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The newly effective FDA regulations will impact how to address
          NeuraLink and any other medical company’s trustworthiness. Cyborgism
          and embedded technology is a future we can neither run nor hide from
          even if we wanted to. However, these regulations will be an important
          factor in determining how future technology and data handling will be
          developed.  While this change might not affect Neta Alexander's
          concerns about her own pacemaker, she can be hopeful that positive
          change is coming into the space. Although there will be no current
          change to her personal situation, this change reflects the validity of
          her concerns. I am excited to follow this space to see how the FDA
          proceeds to increase patient’s privacy and safety with legacy devices.
