                zero-click spyware that enables its deployers to hack into any iPhone or Android smartphone, retrieve
                messages, access location data, cameras and microphones.

                Yingcheep’s experience with unlawful surveillance is far from isolated. Globally, spyware, facial
                recognition cameras, AI-enabled policing and predictive software are sold and marketed as essential
                products for security and counterterrorism.
                As these highly-sophisticated technologies are exchanged transnationally, they are a key feature within
                the expanding arsenals of tools used in state-led campaigns of oppression.

                However, the capabilities for repression inherent within these tools prove to be an increasing threat to
                democracy and human rights. In the 21st century, cyberweapons are profoundly more destabilizing –
                comparatively cheap, easily distributed, deployed with little to no accountability.

                failure to crackdown upon the production and export of such softwares.

                Despite these nation states’ obligation to protect human rights in accordance to international human
                rights law, their failure to act is evidence that many states have little interest in respecting, let

                Philippines, Panama, Kenya, and Mexico, where spyware has reportedly been in use since 2011. Those
                producing and profiting of these technologies – often based in liberal democracies such as Israel,
                Europe and the United States – have only been exposed for their use of these technologies on their own

            <p> When victims do attempt to seek justice in the face of potential violations, they are confronted with a
                myriad of challenges. In Yingcheep’s case, Thai courts were reluctant about the civil lawsuit as such
                cases have no precedence and judges are unfamiliar with the technology. Even if they did win the case,
                victims are unlikely to receive compensation as NSO Group had already declared bankruptcy.

                The victims of spyware are also often activists and minority groups; individuals who are unable to face
                the financial burden, safety threats and added persecution of long, tumultuous legal battles against
                corporations and governments.

                So why go through the hassle? For Yingcheep, pursuing this case is critical as it would set historic
                precedence, not only in Thailand but also for others in Southeast Asia.

            <p>People everywhere are living in an increasingly digital world where surveillance is ubiquitous and
                sometimes, expected. However, the violation of rights are often invisible – even to the victims
                themselves. As core government functions become rapidly digitized under the guise of providing essential
                public services, this matter is not limited to a select few individuals or even countries. Instead, it
                is a call to pushback against the abuse of power that violates human rights everywhere.
