                this essay examines a select moment in the historical development of the internet through the lens of
                coloniality. It continues by speculating on the possible means through which we arrive at a decolonial
                internet, where the internet may instead be used to disrupt logics of extraction and subjugation. The
                notion of colonialism might initially seem distant from present-day discussions about the internet,
                particularly when understood as “a practice of domination involving the subjugation of one people by
                another through military, economic and political means.”

                Following Aníbal Quijano’s notion of the coloniality of power, it may be understood that the subjugation

                cable networks for the internet, while simultaneously complicit in extractive uses of material resources
                and labor in Asia.

                The internet often carries assumptions of being a global information infrastructure that confers
                political agency in its ability to ‘democratize’ flows of information, affording greater political
                participation through its decentering of central sources for media messages. Yet,
                computationally-constructed harms are an inextricable feature of contemporary dysfunction, with the
                internet and its facilitation of data extraction deeply enmeshed within destructive processes of
                surveillance capitalism, algorithmically-augmented inequities, and the persistence of colonial logics.

                To begin contending with these problems, this essay starts with the foundational rhetorics from which
                the present-day internet was developed. These examples will be examined to reveal assumptions of
                universalizing infrastructure and underlying developmental conceptions of ‘civilization.’ With such
                histories of technology often finding their origins in the United States and Europe, this essay invokes
                Brian Larkin in his desire “to discover where their insights have force and where their analytical
                assumptions turn out to be socially specific rather than universal to a technology.”

                This essay operates in three parts. Firstly, it begins with a close reading of a scene from the 1972
                documentary <i>Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing</i>, which features the perspectives
                of computer scientists and engineers directly involved in the development of ARPANET. By analyzing this
                documentary scene by way of the art-historical reference it makes, we examine underlying ideals
                underpinning the ARPANET. Secondly, by examining the rhetoric of “resource sharing” for the network as
                universalizing civilizational technology, the essay threads through different ways in which the logics
                of coloniality underlie the internet. Lastly, through contemporary examples of web-based projects that
                seek to disrupt neocolonial logics, the essay considers how decolonial practices may emerge online, and
                possibilities for a decolonial web that refuses the extractive uses of data and reconfigures data as
                method for contending with the <i>problems to be addressed</i>.

            <p>
                In 1965, while working for ARPA, computer scientist Robert Taylor initiated the funding of advanced
                research in computing at major universities and corporate research centers across the US.

                Often considered the technological precursor laying the technical foundations for the present-day
                internet, the ARPANET emerged from the activities of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the
                United States Department of Defense. The notion of “resource sharing” is articulated as the driving
                force behind Taylor’s development of ARPANET.

                Here, “resource sharing” referred not only to dissemination of data over a network, but also served as a

                Within the documentary, American engineer Lawrence G. Roberts speaks of computer networks as a
                universalizing infrastructure: Working at ARPA, Roberts asserts the necessity of a network like ARPANET
                in the dissemination of information, a form of resource sharing that leads to the formation of an
                advanced ‘civilization.’ Roberts identifies the issue of “small civilizations or small cities trying to
                develop separately and not having any way of sharing what they’ve learnt with other groups.”

                He claims that “if that continues to happen, they don’t have a civilization.” Roberts argues that “the
                necessity was to provide a mechanism so that what was learned one place could be transferred effectively
                and directly to other places without re-doing it all and learning it all over again at each place.”

                Within this framework of information infrastructure, the dissemination of knowledge is entwined with the
                very foundation of ‘civilization.’ This follows a developmental logic: For one to develop as a
                ‘civilization,’ one must follow a predetermined trajectory towards a singular model of civilization
                often based on existing knowledge and structures of power. Even more striking is the image used in the
                documentary during this explanation: During Roberts’ interview, the documentary cuts away to the image
                of an engraving of <i>William Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</i>, based on the 1771–72 oil painting by
                Benjamin West. As Roberts’ voiceover is delivered, the viewer sees close-ups of the engraving, their
                eyes guided across details of this image that depicts the meeting between William Penn and members of
                the Lenni Lenape tribe at Shackamaxon on the Delaware River.

                Through the portrayal of Penn and his associates in the act of bestowing gifts to the Lenape people, the

            <p>
                While initially created to convey Penn’s highly developed moral sensibility, and by extension, the right
                to ownership over the land, the image is now critiqued for obscuring and excusing of later acts of
                betrayal enacted upon Indigenous people, after the Lenape were forced out of traditional homelands due
                to illegal colonial settlements. Instead of a magnanimous exchange, Penn’s ability to ensure peaceful
                relations must be seen in relation to the implicit threat of violence that suffused the European
                colonization of America.

                Through data dissemination’s entwinement with an image of colonial expansion and exploitation, the
                ARPANET’s development is imbued with troubling notions of a universalizing infrastructure that follows a
                developmental conception of ‘civilization.’ In this sense, it is ‘universalizing’ as a system that moves
                towards negating differences across contexts, with aims of achieving a singular vision of an
                often-Western notion of modernity that is assumed to be more advanced, and thus universally beneficial.
                When seen in relation to the idea of “resource sharing” through the ARPANET, the dissemination of data
                cannot be seen as a benevolent exchange. Rather, it foregrounds ideas about information infrastructure
                as a ‘civilizing’ tactic that operates over existing inequities. It is here that “resource sharing” and
                computer networks are imbued with a colonial dimension. Such a relationship between data, the internet,
                and coloniality that has been noted by artists, activists, and academics.

                The artist Keith Obadike points out the “odd Euro colonialist narrative that exists on the web […] there
                are browsers called Explorer and Navigator that take you to explore the Amazon or trade in the ebay.
                It’s all just too blatant to ignore.”

                While colonial dimensions of the internet may function on this semiotic level, the relationship between

            <h2>A Decolonial Web? Migrant Death Map as Case Study</h2>
            <p>
                Terms such as “digital colonialism” foreground the internet’s ability to facilitate resource extraction
                or exploitative labor practices enacted under global capitalism, emphasizing that information
                infrastructures are ultimately able to reproduce the coloniality of power by exacerbating existing
                inequities. In this sense, “resource sharing” as an ideal is conceived on uneven topographies, and while
                conceived as being beneficial to communities, ends up privileging existing structures of power. Given
                the continued manifestation of colonial logics through the internet, this essay re-centers decolonial
                studies in the desire to engage with possible practices in addressing the colonial dimensions of the
                internet. Here, the decolonial approach serves as an “instrument for transforming the world by
                transforming the way people see it, feel it and act in it.”

                The essay turns to the context of Singapore, a highly-networked city enmeshed in the global politics of
                contemporary data flows. As a wealthy postcolonial nation that is simultaneously complicit in extractive
                uses of resources and labor from neighboring contexts in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia,
                examples of online data-based projects like the Migrant Death Map offer examples in using data for
                contending with extractivist or neocolonial logics.

                Described as “a political practice of mapping back,” counter-cartography melds mapping practices with
                theoretical critique. In the context of the Migrant Death Map, it is through the painstaking collection
                of obscured data and the re-acknowledgement of the meanings that have been hidden that the lives of
                migrant workers are mapped and made tangible again, in spite of the lack of government support or biased
                reporting from state-controlled media. To invoke Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein in Data
                Feminism, this is a counter-cartographical practice that maps and creates space for an attunement to the
                “bodies uncounted, undercounted, silenced.”

                The case study of the Migrant Death Map demonstrates several tactics for possible routes towards
                decoloniality through the internet. In the disruption of extractivist logics towards labor, the first
                tactic involves the seeking out and reclaiming of occluded data, of the information missing from
                datasets, and making such silences legible once more. The second observable tactic is the use of a
                longform and multimedia approach, one that complicates the colonial possibilities of the map and the
                archive. By fleshing out the internal lives of migrant workers through audiovisual material, the Migrant
                Death Map resists the reduction of human life to data points. Lastly, the tactic of clear, actionable
                demands based on the careful parsing of data ensures identifiable pathways towards justice for migrant
                workers.

            </p>
            <p>
                In this manner, the Migrant Death Map enacts a vision of a decolonial web through its repurposing of
                data, its emphasis on the <i>problems to be addressed</i>, and its strategic disruption of logics of
                extraction through web-based platforms. If the modern foundation of knowledge is territorial and
                imperial, counter-cartography posits the tactics for refashioning these territories into spaces wherein
                the silenced are made tangible one more. While these practices do not contend with the full injustices
                enacted, facilitated, and exacerbated by the uneven topographies of the internet, they provide us
                tactics for envisioning a decolonial internet and reclaiming data.
