            <p>Cicada 3301 is an anonymous group of people who released internet puzzles that have captured the
                imagination of people around the world. It has been described as "the most baffling and enigmatic
                mystery on the Internet" and was listed as one of the "Top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the
                Internet" by the Washington Post.

                It first appeared on 4chan in 2012 and has since reappeared on several other websites every few years.
                Cicada 3301 puzzles are typically released in batches, with each batch consisting of a series of
                increasingly difficult challenges. The puzzles often involve solving riddles, deciphering codes, and
                finding hidden messages in images and videos. To solve the puzzles, participants must work together and
                share their knowledge and expertise. This has led to the formation of online communities of Cicada 3301
                puzzlers, who collaborate to solve the challenges. The puzzles are highly complex and require a deep
                understanding of cryptography, steganography, and other cryptography techniques. The stated purpose of
                the puzzles is to recruit "highly intelligent individuals." However, the ultimate purpose of Cicada 3301
                remains unknown. There has been much speculation and many theories, including that they are recruitment
                tools for the NSA, MI6, Illuminati, a cult, or a hacker group. Only a handful of people have ever solved
                all of the Cicada 3301 puzzles. Those who have been successful have been rewarded with cryptic messages
                and invitations to join Cicada 3301. However, no one knows what happens to those who join Cicada 3301,
                or what their ultimate goals are.

                    <p>Looking at the image posted on 4chan, it has no obvious prime numbers, but the size of the image
                        is 509 x 503 pixels. It happens that both 509 and 503 are prime numbers. With the original
                        number of 3301 being the third number, you can calculate the total number as 509 x 503 x 3301 =

                    <p>The QR code lead people to another book called Agrippa (A Book of the Dead) by William Gibson.
                        The book contained a poem, which came on a 3.5-inch disk with the book, and was programmed to
                        encrypt itself after a single use. The content of the book redirects people to a series of
                        technical puzzles including the RSA puzzle and the MIDI puzzle.

                        Latin.

                        Jungian psychology and philosophical ideas. The exact meaning and message of the Liber Primus
                        remain a subject of debate and interpretation among those following the Cicada 3301 puzzles.

                    <p>The solved pages of the puzzle utilized Gematria Primus to encode messages. First found during
                        the 2013 puzzle, it is an alphabet with 29 runes, each with an English equivalent and a
                        numerical value, The numerical values are consecutive prime numbers in ascending order. The
                        Gematria Primus alphabet is similar to many old futhorc rune alphabets, but is most similar to
                        an old rune poem. Since Gematria Primus is nearly identical to the poem, it seems to be based on
                        it. A common theory is that 3301 found a prime number-length alphabet and decided to turn that
                        into their alphabet.

                    <p>Looking at the language used in Liber Primus, It is easy to see why some people speculated that
                        Cicada 3301 was a cult. “For All Is Sacred”, “Experience Your Death”, “The Duty Of Every
                        Pilgrim”, and “Find the divinity within and emerge”. In fact, many zealots tried to mimic
                        Cicada's messages on various websites and forums after the release of Liber Primus.

                    <h2>Chapter III - Coincidence, or not? The Possible Origins of Cicada</h2>

                    <p>In the last 10 years, fans and followers have tried every single method imaginable to find the
                        real identity of Cicada 3301. Some of their discoveries have led to surprising yet reasonable
                        connections. One of these connections is a group of people called “Cypherpunks”.
                    </p>

                    <!-- THIS IS NORMAL TEXT WITH A FOOTNOTE -->
                    <p>Solving Cicada puzzles requires public access to strong encryption and a free flow of
                        information. These ideas flourished in the early days of the internet at the University of
                        California, Berkeley, which was one of the early intellectual hubs of the resistance fighting
                        for digital security. In the early 90s, the internet was new and little-understood. However,
                        scientists could already see the potential threats to privacy the government posed, as they
                        could track and record anyone’s activity online without anyone’s knowledge. A group of hackers
                        came together to fight for internet privacy and digital rights. They were graduate students,
                        professors, and staff of UC Berkeley, such as Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore,
                        unified under the name “Cypherpunks”.

                        Because of these beliefs, a mailing list was started in 1992 to facilitate technical discussions

                        discussion. The mailing list was an email address @cicada.berkeley.edu. On top of that, there is
                        a server located in the Soda Hall of UC Berkeley called cicada.berkeley.edu.

                        steganography, data privacy, and the power dynamics within the digital world. Their intricate
                        challenges have ignited a global fascination with cryptography, inspiring a generation of
