<!-- THIS IS NORMAL TEXT -->
<p>Two fundamental concepts have evolved into the digital ecosystem: blockchain technology and the economics
    of attention.
    At first glance, they may seem unrelated. Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies
    and decentralized applications, while attention economics focus on human attention as a scarce and
    valuable resource.
    However, upon deeper analysis, we can see how these two fields intertwine with one another, influencing
    and shaping each other in profound ways.
    <i>There should be many applications based on blockchain technology in the market today. For
        example，D.Tube, Theta Network and Civil.</i>

</p>
<h2> Attention economics

</h2>
<p>
    The term Attention Economy was coined by psychologist, economist and Nobel Prize winner Herbert A.
    Simon.
    He described it as the "bottleneck of the human mind," limiting our ability to perceive and act in
    stimulating environments.
    Attention Economy is a theoretical framework that treats human attention as a finite resource,
    especially in the current electronic age, where a multitude of media and technology platforms are
    competing for our attention.
    Once this attention is secured, it is sold to advertisers for profit.
    As the artist and cultural critic Richard Serra said in 1973, "Television sends people to advertisers,
    and it is the consumers who are consumed.
    You are sent to the advertiser, and the advertiser is the consumer. He consumes you.”

            </span>
        </span></sup>

    This is especially true now of social media platforms, which keep us hooked to our screens by designing
    addictive, interactive user interfaces while also collecting data about our preferences and selling it
    to advertisers.
</p>

<h3>Attention as currency
</h3>
<p>
    We all understand that money is needed to purchase food, water, and shelter. Though perhaps less
    obvious, it turns out attention can also be transformed into tangible substances necessary for survival.
    Especially where information overload is a genuine concern, attention becomes a valuable currency. We
    need to remember that "information is not scarce; it is attention that is scarce."

    Attention, for example, can be compared to patches of forest, which tend to be cut down into trees and
    sold to other buyers.
    And as our economy becomes more and more dependent on attention, that currency will move from existing
    holders to new ones.
    Looking at the history of "attention economics," there is an obvious pattern: technological advances
    drive cultural change.

                2016. introduction

            </span>
        </span></sup>


    From the "New York Sun" in 1833 to the "Paris poster" in France, adding graphics brings the text to
    life.
    There has been a shift from one-dimensional to two-dimensional. The sensory experience has also shifted
    from one-dimensional to multi-sensory, from the radio to the television set.
    Now, with the Internet, we are being exploited in a more holistic party. Advances in technology have
    brought about different media and different industries. But what remains unchanged are the roles.
    It's always been a three-way street between the media, public and the advertisers. Different industries
    play the same roles, doing the same things in different forms.


</p>
<p>
    For example, the newspaper era was dominated by advertisers. While advertisers almost entirely fed the
    newspaper industry, the media became increasingly important in the age of television and the Internet.
    The introduction of companies such as Google and Facebook, which have virtually monopolized the
    attention market and pushed content of interest to users through intelligent algorithms, has created a
    new equilibrium.
    Users went from being passive earners of all information to being interested in their own content, but
    this did not change the user's status, still being exploited. What's more, technological developments
    over the past few decades have enslaved us to various media and devices.
    The Internet has exposed most of us to passive, non-consensual exposure to the commerce of attention
    anywhere, anytime. When you click on a web page, all of your actions are recorded without reservation
    and then, through algorithms, passively received information, and we are left to make choices among the
    passively ingested information.
    It's hard to know "who you really are." You wonder if your choices are your own. So sometimes
    "techniques developed to enhance attentional control sometimes backfire."

    Also, attention affects our consciousness and reshapes our lives.



</p>

<p>
    The issue of data security comes into play here. In the traditional attention economy model, platforms
    own and control users' data. As a result, users can only be passive, but blockchain technology has the
    potential to change all that.


</p>
<h2>
        Blockchain

    

</h2>

<p>
    Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed system defined as a shared, immutable ledger used to
    facilitate the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets across a business network.
    It uses cryptographic keys, encryption and consensus mechanisms to record and update data and
    transactions.

<h3>
    Brave
</h3>
<p>
    Brave is a free, open source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc. and is based on the Chromium
    web platform like Google, Firefox and others.
    Its main feature is its focus on privacy, as it automatically blocks online advertisements and website
    trackers in its default settings.
</p>
<h3>
    BAT

</h3>
<p>
    Bat is an ethereum blockchain-based digital advertising token that allows users to earn BAT tokens by
    browsing ad-supported websites for watching ads.
    They can then choose to donate these tokens to their favorite websites and content creators, or convert
    them to cash.
</p>
<p>
    <i>rave reward system constitutes a new advertising ecosystem composed of creators, users, and
        advertisers</i>



</p>
<p>
    Brave Rewards allows users to earn rewards just for browsing. By earning BAT tokens, users can keep the
    tokens or donate/bounty them to their favorite websites and content creators.
    Moreover, users can transfer their BAT to a crypto wallet and convert it to real money or use it to buy
    more ads on the platform.
    Brave automatically distributes the earnings based on users' time on the site. Moreover, based on
    blockchain technology, browsing history remains private, so users are not identified.

    With a focus on privacy protection, Brave Browser reduces the number of trackers that track your web
    activity. It is faster than other browsers and offers customizable privacy controls.

</p>
<p>
    <i>
        Ad and Tracker Blocking:
    </i>

    Brave blocks ads and other online trackers by default, which not only protects privacy but also speeds
    up the browsing experience by reducing site loading time. And it is the first web browser with a
    built-in cryptocurrency wallet.

</p>
<p>
    User Growth Brave Browser's monthly active users increased from approximately 29 million in 2021 to over
    63 million in 2023, with 23.9 million daily active users.
    This shows the strong growth and potential of Brave Browser and its ecosystem.

<h3>
    Impact
</h3>
<p>

    New models like Brave represent a significant shift away from the traditional advertising model,
    balancing user privacy with the need to monetize websites and content creators.
    Moreover, in the future era of virtual reality, everyone can have their own virtual identity and image.
    They can feel the excitement and attention that traditional celebrities can feel, that feeling of being
    watched all the time, because there will be no more platforms to limit them, and they can resell their
    attention freely and creatively.
    Meanwhile, this system naturally incentivizes the creation of quality content. Users want more attention
    and tokens; they will have to generate more engaging and valuable content.
    Since such a system does not require a mediator, creators get more revenue, users' privacy is more
    protected, and the user experience is enhanced. Such a virtuous ecological cycle would be a breakthrough
    for the current economic chain.

</p>
<h3>
    Future Concern/Thoughts

</h3>
<p>
    There's always going to be concerns with new technology. Users, businesses, and media platforms are
    constantly playing a game. All the technology is positive at the beginning.
    Bitcoin, for example, was initially promoted as virtually free, but later transaction costs increased
    significantly and processing speeds were limited.

            </span>
        </span></sup>
    The drive for profit will always gradually swallow this kind of public good. So, can a new platform like
    Brave change all that?
    Brave Browser in particular had caused controversy when it added a whitelisting of certain third-party
    domains in an update, including Facebook URLs used to track users, which contradicted its image as a
    security- and privacy-conscious browser.

        </span></sup>







</p>
<p>
    Additionally, an important aspect of the brave platform is the blocking of advertisements, which users
    can subjectively choose and be rewarded for.
    However, for example, in the era of television, the invention of the "remote control" brought some hope
    in the passive acceptance of countless advertisements because the user can have the right to choose to
    watch or not to watch; you can keep switching programs to cater to their preferences, but all this does
    not change the position of the user.
    Although it stimulates the creation of advertising content and competition in the market, the user is
    still exploited. That is why I am worried that blockchain technology will now become another "remote
    control." Users can indeed choose to accept ads or not. But will it be a different business model, even
    though it may have struck a better balance than before?



</p>

<p>
    Besides, as part of cryptocurrency, the future of this model will largely depend on the currency's
    value, and there will only be enough interest to attract more people to join. So there is still some
    risk for this.

</p>

<h2>
    
        Conclusion
    
</h2>
<P>
    Monetizing the attention economy for users through blockchain technology presents a promising
    opportunity for cooperation, but it remains to be seen whether it solves the fundamental problem of
    users retaining the right to their data and the right to privacy.
    I would like to leave you with the following question: "But on the way to heaven, if there is no
    ubiquitous media, what should people pay attention to? What should people do with their lives?”
