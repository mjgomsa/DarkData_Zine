            <p>From widely-discussed concerns over induced paranoia, to striking journalistic findings on potential
                privacy breaches, peer-to-peer surveillance technologies like Ring and Citizen are not new to public
                scrutiny. Ring, Amazon’s residential security system, offers smart home devices and a complimentary
                social network. Citizen, a mobile app founded by programmer Andrew Frame, uses alerts and live
                broadcasting to inform users of localized incidents. Critics underline that the proliferation of these
                products in the past few years indicates a growing obsession with constantly watching others, under the
                guise of maintaining safety. In this manner, Ring and Citizen are often categorized alongside each other
                as digital tools driven by perpetual suspicion and imminent danger.</p>

            <p>While this aggregated understanding correctly emphasizes distressing trends in modern sousveillance, the
                differences between the two technologies can provide additional critical insight. Analyzing the unique
                contexts of both Ring and Citizen reveals their intersections and overlaps; ultimately affirming their
                implication within a larger neoliberal system that operates on fear and profit-making.</p>

            <h2>The Suburb and The City</h2>

            <p>At the outset, Ring and Citizen can be regarded as sousveillance technologies developed for fundamentally
                opposite environments. The American suburb, Ring’s stronghold, finds its roots in homogeneity,
                segregationist practices, and Cold War anxieties over an impending attack from “the enemy”. Its identity
                has been built upon a promise of security, sanctity and privacy for its constituents. Keli Gabinelli, in
                her article “False Alarm”, illustrates that the emergence of a neoliberal paradigm following the 1970s
                resulted in security becoming a matter of individual responsibility.

                        </span>
                    </span></sup>

                Since then, all threats to sanctity have been approached with peer-to-peer surveillance, where the value
                of privacy isn’t promised to anyone seemingly encroaching the bounds of a private property. The suburban
                home’s door then becomes a crucial site, protecting everything behind it from the unknowns on the other
                side. In the form of hardware, Ring latches itself onto this very barrier and becomes an interlocutor
                between the sacred inside and the scary outside.
            </p>

            <p>Away from the sprawling cul-de-sacs, Citizen operates in the American city; a place described by writer
                and activist Jane Jacobs as an ecosystem “with life at its most complex and intense.”

                In the mid-century, white flight to the suburbs, partially motivated by an aversion to racial
                integration, accelerated systemic and structural issues within cities. Being deemed as ‘crime-ridden’
                and ‘decaying’, urban centers were met with rigorous renewal plans that disproportionately harmed Black
                and Brown communities. Jacobs famously led the charge in opposing many such redevelopment projects in
                downtown Manhattan, with a grassroots approach that prioritized community building and organizational
                power. In her seminal book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, she called for residents to
                band together and “keep their eyes on the street” to maintain social order and safety, setting a
                precedent for the neighborhood watch.

            <p>Over 70 years later, Citizen has framed itself as a digital manifestation of this method and strives to
                become a “global safety network of people protecting each other.”

                    </span></sup>

                The app, currently operating in 60 American cities, is driven by horizontal relays of information,
                including crowdsourced reports and dispatches gathered from police scanners. Its use is predicated on
                the idea of concerned civilians striving to protect their local communities through observation,
                documentation and reporting.
            </p>

            <p>In reality, Citizen and the many other de facto interpretations of “eyes on the street” do little more
                than exacerbate paranoia within communities. The act of specifically watching one’s surroundings for
                instances of disorder invariably creates a state of constant suspicion and fear. This condition extends
                beyond a localized scope: much has been said on how the amplified threat of terror following 9/11 and
                subsequent ongoing crises have resulted in a large-scale generalization of emergency, exception and
                anxiety in the last two decades.

            </p>

            <p>Such an environment is further complicated when recognizing the role of embedded racial biases, whereupon
                Black and Brown people are more likely to be deemed as suspicious in the public sphere: a space,
                described by author Simone Browne, as being “shaped for and by whiteness.”

                Jacobs herself has been criticized for her inability to address race in the context of housing and the
                commons, and the urgent and all-encompassing modalities of both Ring and Citizen are not any better at
                doing so. Neighbors, Ring’s own neighborhood watch app with doorbell footage, has developed a culture
                “obsessed with crime and self-policing”, with users often racially profiling recorded individuals

                    </span></sup>

                Similarly, Citizen was initially launched under the name “Vigilant”, and was subsequently taken off the
                Apple app store after many cited risks of “physical harm to people” and pointed out the racialized
                vigilantism that the tool could greenlight.
            </p>

            <h2>Stability and Shakiness</h2>

            <p>The intended environments of both apps, be it the enclosed house or the open city commons, subsequently
                influence the mobility of the key sousveillance apparatus: the camera. The aforementioned barrier of the
                suburban home --the door -- serves as a place of adherence for Ring’s technology. The point of view is
                immovable and continuous; anything that comes within the range of a ‘secured’ home has no choice but to
                be recorded. The camera’s 160º fisheye lens offers some additional peripheral insight and an infrared
                option ensures documentation at all times of day. Ring also boasts 1080p resolution for all its
                products, and in their own words, allows users “to see absolutely everything going in and around” one’s
                home. The resulting footage is clear and established, echoing Liat Berdugo’s notion that “the stability
                of an image is its power”.

                <!-- THIS IS A FOOTNOTE -->
                <sup><span class="footnote"><a rel="noopener" href="#Bibliography">7</a>

                    </span></sup>
            </p>

            <p>Contrary to Ring’s almost paternalistic secureness, videos on Citizen are shaky and hand-held. Whereas
                Ring’s stable doorbell camera offers an inward residential safety, Citizen leverages the smartphone
                camera as a vector for information in the public square. Its mobility is its characterizing feature, and
                conjures values of diligence, duty and initiative. The app’s constant calls for users to “Go Live” and
                report on nearby incidents contribute to a heightened sense of immediacy and place. As such, all footage
                from Citizen is intrinsically tied to one’s physical position and larger positionality when navigating
                an urban environment. This is demonstrated through people streaming protests and using the app to “stay
                ahead of planned police action”. Notably, Citizen saw record numbers of downloads during the waves of
                demonstrations against police brutality in 2020.

                In such cases, the unique contexts of its users the app allows for it to expand beyond a crime-tracker
                and be interpreted as a tool for solidarity.
            </p>

            <p>However, Alice Riddell, writing on the unexpected uses of Citizen in Brooklyn, observes how the company’s
                murky relationship with local law enforcement may undermine this flexibility.

                She notes that Bill Bratton, an ex-police commissioner in the NYPD, serves as an executive on the app’s
                board. In his time as commissioner, Bratton implemented the controversial broken windows policing theory
                that took a zero-tolerance approach to “public disorder”, and resulted in racialized arrests and
                increased brutality.

                Increased cooperation with law enforcement challenges Citizen’s ability to exist as a horizontal
                infrastructure, and especially so for communities that are routinely targeted by the police.

            <p>Ring’s cooperation is far less obscured: Caroline Haskins reported in Motherboard that the company had
                partnered with over 600 police departments in 2019. In certain partnerships, police departments
                maintained Ring camera registries and could legally obtain footage recorded from installed systems.
                Privacy-tradeoffs are further amplified when recognizing the possibility of anyone locating cameras from
                the content posted on Neighbors. A data investigation conducted by Gizmodo revealed that all posts were
                accompanied by “hidden coordinates” that were essentially visible to any Ring user; these coordinates
                could then be used to pinpoint Ring cameras and their connected homes.

                The examination also found that several cameras were closely situated to sensitive locations that
                largely benefit from geographic discretion, like abortion clinics and immigration offices. Even if the
                decision to own a Ring camera may be individually made, the general nature of sousveillance entails that
                everyone around a ‘secured’ property is unwittingly a part of that decision.

            <p>Such gaps in data privacy and obfuscated law enforcement relationships indicate that those who believe
                they are “watching” aren’t necessarily free from being “watched” themselves. Citizen users sharing
                footage of their surroundings may find themselves recorded as a part of someone else’s livestream. Ring
                users uploading videos from their doorbell cameras may unwittingly disclose their home locations on
                social platforms. As sousveillance systems expand their networks, the positions of being “behind the
                camera” and “in front of the camera” may find themselves in a constant state of flux.</p>

            <h2> Deceptive Interfaces and our Neoliberal Hell</h2>

            <p>Riddell uses the concept of “perpetual opportunism” when speaking on the modern technical state of always
                being connected and supplied with information. Both Ring and Citizen exemplify this condition, giving
                one the ability to obtain a gaze of their surroundings without looking away from their phones. The apps
                go so far as to reach out to their respective users and notify them if something within their vicinity
                might warrant their immediate attention. In the case of Ring, innocuous incidents (like a crawling bug)
                result in the same notice, and can gradually render urgent alerts into digital nuisances. Similarly,
                Citizen’s repetitive notifications are often the subject of jokes on other social platforms, with people
                emphasizing its overwhelming barrage of decontextualized information. </p>

            <p>Citizen’s live-streaming feature also allows users to spectate and comment on incidents as they unfold in
                real time. The feature includes chats and emoji reactions, creating an interactive experience that blurs
                the line between urgently broadcasted material and content serving to lightly entertain. These
                voyeuristic appeals form a crucial infrastructure for the app, with Citizen reportedly paying people
                upwards of $25 an hour to track and stream events, and create more content for it to disseminate.

                            https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595648/citizen-app-crime-scene-paid-live-streamer-nyc-la-emergencies.</span>

                The app’s primary feature is a dark map scattered with some yellow and red dots, representing isolated
                recent incidents. However, a majority of the map is populated with smaller grey dots that indicate past
                incidents, which are only viewable for those upgraded to Citizen Plus. It takes very little time on the
                app to discover that many of its front-facing features are essentially locked unless a user opts to pay
                $19.99 a month. Notably, the map offers a view of registered offenders that immediately prompts an
                “Upgrade” popup upon interacting. At the time of writing this article, the app affixed a countdown
                ticker at the top of the screen, offering a Black Friday discount to its users for a limited amount of
                time.

                <h1>Both [apps] exist as monetized systems that exploit real-life incidents and employ deceptive
                    interfaces.</h1>
            </div>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, Ring’s mobile counterpart Neighbors does not fall short of selling products as well.
                Compared to the pressing nature of Citizen’s monetized features, Ring’s approach feels lighter and
                appeals to typical consumerist sensibilities. At the top of the app, users can scroll through a carousel
                of features: a tab for community resources, on issues like mental health and lost pets, is placed next
                to a tab advertising the best Amazon Prime deals of the week. The community feed consists of uploaded
                clips that display a footer detailing the kind of Ring product used to make the recording. Users can
                click the footer to buy the detailed product, in the case that a post compels anyone to make a purchase.
            </p>

            <p>Between content from actual users, the community feed often features clips of footage posted by a
                verified “Neighbors Team”. These videos range from lighthearted gaffes (such as people slipping on ice
                and laughing it off) to acts of heroism (like that of a neighbor alerting a family of their burning
                garage). All clips effectively depict Ring as a tool with a boundless capacity for positivity, with the
                recorded footage existing as unarguable proof. The company even maintains a YouTube channel, with
                saccharine videos that rack up thousands of views. With this, Ring has found a way to create viral
                content produced by its customers, which can then be used to market their own products. <a

                    to Amazon.</a> Perhaps its most controversial use of recorded clips comes in the form of a
                syndicated television series called “Ring Nation”. Legal scholar Andrew Guthrie Ferguson characterizes
                the show as Amazon’s attempt to normalize “the business of selling surveillance as a service”
