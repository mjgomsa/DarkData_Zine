        <p>
          In the virtual world, he was promised the sky, <br>A child of ones and
          zeroes, they whispered, "You can fly." <br>They lured him in with
          connection and knowledge, so divine, <br>Promising a world where the
          boundaries were undefined. <br /><br />
          He fell in love with screens, the thrill of the unknown, <br>As hours
          turned to days, a cyberspace of his own. <br>They provided the playground,
          a digital escape, <br>But the terms were buried deep, in layers of fine
          print and red tape.
          <br /><br />
          For years, he gave them his time, unpaid and uncredited,<br> A user in
          their kingdom, always connected. <br>He built their dreams, one click at a
          time,<br> As they watched him toil, his essence on the line.
          <br /><br />
          Bit by bit, they sculpt him, shaping his digital frame, <br>He was merely
          a fractal in their vast, endless game. <br>The lines blurred between real
          and online,<br> His true self fading, as their influence entwined.
          <br /><br />
          As pixels painted his thoughts, reality became haze, <br>Each click, each
          like, fueled by the digital maze. <br>His mind a canvas, painted with
          their narrative, <br>A puppet, unsuspecting, in their scheme he was
          captive.
          <br /><br />
          In the midst of all the noise, he yearned to find his face, <br>His heart
          cried out for purpose, to break from this embrace. <br>The labyrinth of
          ones and zeroes, he would transcend,<br> But the sacrifice unfolded; his
          thoughts they did mend.
          <br /><br />
          He woke to the truth, a realization so stark,<br> His actions, his
          beliefs, manipulated in the dark. <br>Controlled and influenced, a pawn in
          their game, <br>For profit, their agenda, the ultimate aim.
          <br /><br />
          He realized too late, the web of deceit that they'd spun,<br> Their
          promises of connection, their game had all been won. <br>The man he had
          become? A metric in their song,<br> Unwittingly complicit, as his true
          self was gone.
          <br /><br />
          In the end, he found no escape, no path to reclaim, <br>For his true self
          was buried beneath the weight of the game. <br>The man he became, a
          reflection of the price, <br>Trapped in a digital world, controlled by
          their device.
