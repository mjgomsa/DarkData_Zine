        <p>
          What exactly is The College Board? Well, I got to know about them in a
          very rude awakening in the Summer of 2019, when I started my college
          application prep in my junior year of high school . Like any other kid
          applying to universities in the U.S. I prepped for the dreadfull SAT.
          I was satisfied with my score and proceeded to the remaining
          components of my application. What I didn’t anticipate was the wave of
          admissions spam that was going to come my way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a very methodical person. I set a clear plan, and I stick to it.
          Unlike other students, I had a very short list of design schools
          around the world I was applying to, and that list was not going to get
          any longer. What I didn’t realize was that I had accidentally enrolled
          into The College Board’s Student Search Function. This meant that tons
          of colleges, many of which I didn’t even know existed, started
          spamming me. Colleges like Loyola, Fordham, Rochester, Syracuse, Hult,
          Pepperdine, etc. were some of the “top contenders” who were competing
          for my attention and inbox space. When I didn’t pick up on initial
          outreach emails, they upped their offer to include application fee
          waivers. Tempting, but not enough to lead me astray from my set path.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward to 2020, I had already committed to Parsons School of
          Design, my top choice, and just like everybody else, I was checked out
          at home during the initial stages of the pandemic. But guess who
          clearly hadn’t checked out? The admissions teams of various colleges
          were continuously telling me about their plans and so I started to
          opt-out of college spam emails individually. I think The College Board
          also had a global opt-out feature but that didn’t work at all. It
          dawned on me that The College Board had obtained my data for free,
          sold it to colleges for a fee, and delivered some value on their
          products.

          If we take a deeper look at the income streams of The College Board,
          they make money by selling their test prep books, various standardized
          testing products like the SATs, PSATs, APs, etc., conferences,
          training, fees on submitting applicant test results to colleges, and
          selling applicant data to colleges. All that income streams just to
          deliver some good shareholder value by a “not-for-profit” entity that
          gains profits by targeting minors through nefarious means? sounds
          ironic.

          The monopoly of the mafia syndicate of The College Board is reaching
          new heights every year and I think we need to take a deeper look at
          their practices. Their monopolistic tactics are constantly putting
          pressure on young kids both mentally and physically, when it comes to
          their gatekeeping strategies, unrealistic fees and penalties, and
          monetization of key services like sending your scores is totally
          absurd and blatant abuse of their powers, profiting off children’s
          fears and insecurities.

          Every year The College Board “innovates” something to address their
          shortcomings. In an NYT article, The College Board was slammed for
          their “adversity” index that ranked students on a “scale of 0-100
          pseudoscientific index of oppression.

          The fact that test-takers have to pay an additional fee to receive an
          analysis of their scores and mistakes is totally absurd, considering
          the already expensive testing is a burden for many test-takers. After
          the USC admissions scandals, there were several allegations of
          cheating on the SATs with “expert test takers.”

          In a recent move, the University of California system has scrapped the

          The College Board is plagued with several controversies and there is
          hard evidence that standardized testing, which was founded by several
          elite schools like Harvard in the 1920s, the very thing that was
          supposed to level the playing field and provide a means for bright
          students to achieve greatness, is inherently flawed and
          discriminatory.

          A future where students from low-economic backgrounds and disabilities
          have an equal opportunity and representation when it comes to college
          admissions and minors are not preyed upon by big companies for their
          money, data, attention, and their minds.

        <p>
          Now that I’m about to graduate, it seems so funny and weird to see how
          data driven decisions and targeted advertising could’ve played such an
          important and pivotal role in my life. The cookies that tracked me
          when I first visited Parson’s website, uploaded my portfolio on a
          third-party service, and submitted my application on a common
          application portal, the same cookies must have recorded my activities
          and played a pivotal role in my application decisions.I don’t know
          what volume of targeted advertising was used to influence my choices
          when it comes to choosing a college and committing to one but I’m
          pretty sure that the number is not zero. Maybe targeted advertising is
          the reason why I came to Parsons and attended a class called Dark Data
          and used this opportunity to rant about targeted advertising and data
          ethics of The College Board.
