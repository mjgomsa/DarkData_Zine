            <h2>When AI becomes mundane</h2>

            <!-- THIS IS NORMAL TEXT WITH A FOOTNOTE -->
            <p>There are two questions that pop up in my mind: When does AI become mundane? and What would happen when
                AI becomes mundane. In every click, people often overlook the fact that each action in the digital
                network has a tangible impact on real life. I am intrigued by how each click on the Internet intricately
                molds our physical environment. Edwards’ emphasis on distributed forces within infrastructure prompts a
                nuanced understanding of the intricate power dynamics inherent in technological systems. Latour’s
                examination of seemingly mundane artifacts expands this understanding, highlighting the societal
                implications woven into everyday technologies. Additionally, Crawford’s insightful perspective in 'The
                Atlas of AI' guides us to contemplate the material and physical infrastructure essential for training
                machine learning models, encouraging reflection on the tangible resources and infrastructural demands
                embedded in AI development. Collectively, these perspectives provide a comprehensive lens through which
                we can better contextualize the impact when AI becomes an everyday necessity, akin to water,
                electricity, and gas. To delve into the practical aspects, I will use the hardware requirements, cost,
                and time needed for personal training of models on Google Colab as a reference. This will help explain
                the relationship between this technology and the public.

            <!-- THIS IS NORMAL TEXT WITH A FOOTNOTE -->
            <p>In order to evaluate the relationship between AI, physical infrastructure, and the public, we must first
                define what an AI infrastructure is. The truth is it’s almost impossible to simply describe the
                relationship between Artificial Intelligence and physical infrastructures. In 1996-97, the U.S.
                President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) chose transportation, water supply,
                government services, electrical power, information, communication, etc, as fundamental to its own
                definition of infrastructure

                . Where does AI fit in this framework? The answer is everywhere. As Crawford
                described “AI is born from salt lakes in Bolivia and mines in Congo, constructed from crowd
                worker-labeled datasets that seek to classify human actions, emotions, and identities.”

                We can no longer
                regard Machine Learning as a single new tool exclusive to one region or country under globalization. The
                emergence of Artificial Intelligence is inevitable from a macro perspective of the history of classical
                computation and telecommunication development. Having shown that AI exists for versatile applications on
                a global scale the way infrastructure does, we will now see how they also share the same initial
                element: force.

            <p>When we think of AI, do we think of Alan Turing, Sam Altman, or Elon Musk? Countless workers are engaged
                in the laborious task of labeling for fine-tuning models. In Edwards’ framework, he considers
                infrastructures on different scales of force, time, and social organization, in the force sector,

                . It is easy to think of digital services and AI models as freeing
                humans from physical labor. In reality, the opposite is true. Artificial Intelligence is only made
                possible by a large workforce working literally from the ground up, through mining, transportation,
                engineering, and other operations. The vastness and freedom of the digital space are an illusion. Each
                computing unit occupies a volume in real life. The more we evolve into modernized societies, the more we
                forget the relationship between built infrastructures, human labor, and natural resources. Therefore,
                with the scale of “force” to frame, we can dive deeper into the practical aspects like logistics and
                water usage.
                <br>

                The status of logistics is closely linked to the technology industry. In recent years, shipping vessels
                produced 3.1 percent of yearly global carbon dioxide emissions, more than the total produced by Germany

                By observing this data, we can see that the demand for the infrastructure needed to build these AI
                services is continually increasing. However, this demand is often overlooked, as these facilities are
                typically constructed in suburban or uninhabited areas. This system blurs the boundaries between
                physical and environmental costs and digital services of AI infrastructure. Although it is difficult to
                quantify how many resources are required to complete each click online, what we can see is that as
                artificial intelligence becomes more popular, our demand for logistical services will also increase. The
                same situation can also be seen in the story of water.

            <!-- THIS IS NORMAL TEXT WITH A FOOTNOTE -->
            <p>In light of these challenges, I personally decided to take a step back and embark on creating my own
                model. By attempting to calculate and understand the intricate forces at play in AI development, I aim
                to contribute to the broader conversation about the often unnoticed elements that shape the AI
                landscape. This hands-on approach aligns with Latour’s call to consider the various components,
                including sourcing materials and labor, as integral to comprehending the full scope of AI's existence.
                <br>
                I utilized Scotch-and-Soda, a Video Shadow Detection framework developed by Lihao Liu. Regarding the
                need for computing power, my option is to rent a graphics processing unit (GPU) on Google Colab. The
                subscription fee for advanced GPU instances with 100 computing units is $100 per month, and if you
                exceed 100 units, additional units must be purchased. Regardless of the model being trained, using the
                A100 GPU consumes 13.08 units per hour, resulting in an average cost of $1.35 per hour. It raises the
                question: what tasks justify these expenses? How much is allocated to maintaining and building data
                centers, and how much goes to the cooling system? These costs do not account for the time spent manually
                labeling images by laborers yet.

                beat the professional Go player, Fan Hui, in
                2015, the public started noticing the potential of machine learning. Then OpenAI launched their product
                ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) in 2020, and the rest is history. Interestingly, this
                happened during the lockdown period. Every Internet user around the world wanted to see what this AI
                chatbot could do. Since then, panicked reports on the matter also appeared in rapid succession, with one
                former Google software engineer, Blake Lemoine, arguing that the AI model, LaMDA, that Google was
                developing had its own consciousness

                Venturing from the initial curiosity about the impact of every click to traversing the pages of
                Crawford’s book and finally, returning to the computer to train the model myself, the process unfolds as
                a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. Yet, as the curtain pulled back, questions emerged. Are the
                data running behind these AI platforms and are the resources they consume properly regulated? As AI
                gradually becomes mundane, can we discern in the receipts how and where every penny is used, and what
                impact it has on the environment? The conclusion invites reflection on the hidden costs, in financial,
                infrastructural, and environmental, that accompany the integration of AI into our everyday lives. It
                prompts us to consider the responsibility that comes with the normalization of AI and the imperative to
                ensure transparency in its development and utilization.
