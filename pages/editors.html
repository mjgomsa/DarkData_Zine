          The multitude of labels and the frequency at which new identifiers are
          introduced reveals important phenomena: how rapidly tech developments
          are being introduced and how quickly and unpredictably they affect the
          data landscape, how stark power imbalances have become between those
          who control the tech and those who consume it, and how divided our
          society has become. Alarmingly, the names we give to our time seem all
          too eager to leave the human behind. They are pessimistic—prioritizing
          the machine above the person, resting power with corporations over

          The Fall 2023 semester has proven to be a pivotal chapter in this
          narrative, marked by a cascade of exciting and, at times,
          disconcerting developments that have reshaped the contours of how we
          perceive, utilize, and regulate data. TikTok's decision to open a data
          center in Europe to calm regulators and Meta's introduction of a
          subscription fee for an ad-free experience reflect the ongoing global
          debate on data sovereignty and the monetization of user information.
          Concurrently, Meta's introduction of celebrity AI chatbots raises
          questions about the boundaries of AI-driven interactions. These and
          many other current events inform this collection of articles and
          underscore the urgency of our exploration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On a more positive note, the largest antitrust trial in history
          against Google and the case against Meta for its negligent practices
          regarding teens and children indicate that regulation of tech giants
          may finally have arrived. The astronomic speed at which AI is evolving
          in a regulatory wasteland should caution our optimism. To avoid
          repeating the mistakes of the past with more dire effects, we insist
          upon the urgent need for rules around the ethics, transparency and
          application of AI.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As editor, I want to emphasize the imperative need for heightened
          transparency in data practices across the board. The staggering
          profits accrued by firms through the sale or manipulation of user
          data, and state entities amassing vast troves of information through
          opaque practices for equally opaque purposes underscore that knowledge
          is indeed power. A future marked by enhanced digital awareness among
          users is essential. I fervently believe that it is only through
          comprehensive knowledge of how a system operates that one can improve
          upon it: knowledge is also agency. This agency is ever the more urgent
          at a time where the convenience and ease-of-use of AI threatens to
          increase the passivity and outsourcing of intelligence of users.

          Together we are proud to publish the works of 14 authors from
          Professor David Carroll’s “Dark Data” course, taught at Parsons School
          of Design, The New School. Their diverse perspectives have resulted in
          a collection that spans academic articles, poems, case studies, web
          designs, and personal experiments, providing a comprehensive
          exploration of the multifaceted realm of dark data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each article is a deep dive into some of the topics we have explored
          this semester, including data collection and tracking, surveillance,
          digital power imbalances and the rise of artificial intelligence. The
          pieces scrutinize the intricate relationships between these themes,
          shedding light on the profound impact they have on privacy, security,
          and the ethical considerations surrounding data practices.
